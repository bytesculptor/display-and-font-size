# Display and font size

As a developer, I like to test my apps to see the different font and display scales. 
Until now, I didn't find another way than to go to the settings and change it manually, what is very annoying and time consuming.
This app can change the font scale with a button (needs System Settings Write Permission!). 

Next planned features:
- change the display scale too (it seems there is currently no way to do this programmatically, there is a feature request pending at Google)
- change the scale on a widget
